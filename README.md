# JellyBeans
Within a random photo of jelly beans, is it possible to determine what percent of the picture is made up of yellow beans? The short answer is yes, it is possible using the PIL module in python. The PIL module is responsible for the majority of image processing within python due to the diversity of the package and its multiple functions. This code specifically first imports the image, and sets variables that to go through every pixel available in the photo. By setting the variables, width and height, and initializing a value to zero, the code can traverse each individual pixel, evaluate the colour, and add it to an individual colour counter. Using RGB values, and defining the colour spectrum that yellow falls under, a nested for loop is used to sort through pixels. Once the total number of yellow pixels is determined , they are divided by the resolution of the image (width times height) and multiplied by 100 to determine that around 17% of the photo is comprised of yellow jelly beans.
